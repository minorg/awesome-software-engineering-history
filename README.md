# Awesome Software Engineering History  [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

An [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) of books, videos, and other resources for learning about the history of software engineering.

The list is geared towards new and practicing software engineers, rather than professional historians. Most of the sources are secondary and tertiary rather than primary, "history" rather than "historical". For lists of seminal papers and other primary sources, see the [Other lists section](#other-lists).

Items in **bold** are good starting points.
